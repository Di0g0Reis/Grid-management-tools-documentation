# About this Project

Welcome to the official documentation site for our project on [Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow](sc_opf.md) (SC-OPF), developed at [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/pt#intro) by members of the Center for Power and Energy Systems (CPES).

This project focuses on advancing methodologies and tools for solving SC-OPF problems, contributing to the reliable and secure operation of modern power systems.

Here, you will find comprehensive documentation about the project, including technical details, background, and a step-by-step tutorial to guide you in using the code. Whether you're a researcher, practitioner, or simply interested in the field, we hope this resource will help you better understand and apply security-constrained OPF techniques.

If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to us through our respective channels at INESC TEC.



Thank you for visiting!
