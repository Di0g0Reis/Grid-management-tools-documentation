This section provides an overview of the data structures and files required to run the SC-OPF (Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow) and MP-OPF (Multi Period Optimal Power Flow) solvers. Each of the following subpages describes a specific input file, its purpose, structure, and the required information to ensure a proper execution of the optimization routines.
The required files are:
=== "Files"

    * [Topology of the electrical grid](topology.md)
    * [Configuration parameters](config_params.md)
    * [Production and Consumption data](prod_cons.md)
    * [Market data](market.md)
    * [Execution File](directory.md)

Each subpage in this section explains how to create and structure these files properly, detailing the required fields, data formats, and any important considerations.

By the end of this section, you should have a complete understanding of the required datasets and how to prepare them for successful execution of both solvers.
