# SC-OPF & MP-OPF: Power Flow Optimization Tools

Welcome to the documentation for **SC-OPF** (Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow) and **MP-OPF** (Multi-Period Optimal Power Flow), a suite of tools for advanced power system optimization. These models are designed to help engineers, researchers, and system operators simulate and solve power flow problems under realistic system and operational constraints.

---

## âš¡ Overview

- **SC-OPF** ensures secure operation under contingency scenarios (N-1 security), modeling system behavior after potential equipment failures.
- **MP-OPF** optimizes over multiple time periods, capturing ramping limits, storage behavior, and temporal constraints (e.g., load or generation profiles over time).

These tools can be used independently or combined for security-aware, time-coupled optimization in power systems.

- Built-in **N-1 contingency analysis**
- **Ramp rate modeling** for generators
- Integration with industry-standard solvers (e.g., Pyomo)
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Support for **IEEE benchmark cases**
